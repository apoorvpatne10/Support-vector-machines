# Support-vector-machines

The goal is same for now, that is to predict a salary of a potential new employee based on the positions of the previous companies he worked in! But this time, it'll be done using Support vector machines. Skyyyaa! skiddii pap pa pa!
I've tried doing this with and without scikit learn libraries. Thanks to [Siraj](https://goo.gl/eBdtk1)!
